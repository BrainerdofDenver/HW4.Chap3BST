# HW4.Chap3BST
Instructor Blanche,

I tried building my own BST class from the ground up only to find that I relied too heavily on
a self pointing variable in the class from which most of my methods refered. This caused problems instantiating objects from
the class. Additionally, I had created a few unnecissary methods in the hopes it would lend to shortcuts in later class methods.
Ultimately the object class was a cludge and I was unable to implement it into the assignment.

Thank you,
Andrew
